        <h3>Nostalgic Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            Back in the day, during my high school years, League of Legends was not just a game for me; it was a way of life. I immersed myself in the League of Legends universe for four consecutive years. Those were the days when my friends and I would spend countless hours strategizing, battling, and honing our skills on the Summoner's Rift. It wasn't just a game; it was a virtual world where I forged lasting connections with many incredible individuals, both from across the globe and right in my own backyard.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beauty of League of Legends lay in its ability to bring people together, transcending geographical boundaries. I can still recall the excitement of meeting fellow gamers who shared my passion for the game. These virtual friendships often transcended the digital realm, leading to real-life meetups and unforgettable experiences.

        <h3>Wise Moves</h2>
          <p>
              However, as the final year of high school approached, I knew it was time to turn my attention to the next chapter of my life: college. I made the bittersweet decision to step away from League of Legends, a game that had provided me with so much joy and camaraderie. It was time to bid farewell to the Summoner's Rift and embark on a new journey.

        <h2>Trial 101</h2>

        <p>
            With that said, my transition from the world of gaming to the world of cloud computing was a profound one. I decided to channel my passion for technology and problem-solving into the realm of DevOps. 
        </p> 
        <p> 
            The idea of orchestrating infrastructure, optimizing workflows, and automating processes fascinated me. That's when I dived headfirst into the world of so many DevOps tools like Terraform and cloud services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I'm proud to say that I've found my calling in DevOps towards the innovation that may change everything to more better.
            My League of Legends days may be behind me, but the lessons I learned about teamwork, strategy, and continuous improvement continue to guide me in my current endeavors.

            Life is a journey, and mine has taken me from the virtual battles of League of Legends to the cloud-powered landscapes of Terraform and DevOps. And I couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead.        </p>
