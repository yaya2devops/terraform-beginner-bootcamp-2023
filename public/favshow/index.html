        <h2>Why I Love Breaking Bad</h2>
        <p>
            Back in 2018, <b>at the age of just 16</b>, I immersed myself in watching the show that profoundly resonated with me and left a lasting impact on my perspective. 
            </p>
            <p>Its compelling characters, intense storytelling, and moral complexities..<br> A show that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
        </p>

        <h3>A Gift from a Friend</h2>
        <p>        
            I watched it with a very close friend of mine I've known since <b>the fifth grade</b>. <br>He also gave this to me as a gift, a testament to our shared interest for BB! <b>I loved it.</b>
        </p>

        This figure was acquired precisely on <b>July 26, 2018</b>, and the picture was taken on <b>August 18</b> of the same year. I'm also a BIG fan of anime, particularly <b>Seven Deadly Sins,</b> <b>Dragon Ball Z,</b> and the fantastic <b>Inazuma Eleven!</b>

        <h4>Unforgettable Moments</h4>
        <p>        
            I've  included some of the most memorable quotes which I love and I believe truly encapsulate the unforgettable characters and moments that have left an indelible mark on my journey.

        </p>

        <h5>A Recommendation Worth Considering</h4>
            <p>        
                If you haven't given it a shot, I highly recommend watching Breaking Bad! While the first season may start off a bit slow, once you get into it, you'll find it impossible to stop until you've reached the end.
            </p>
