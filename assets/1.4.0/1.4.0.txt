
S3 Static website hosting 

- configure bucket for s3 static webite hosting
- upload an index.html via the console
- upload an error.html via the console
- upload an index.html via the tf
- upload an error.html via the tf
- update our output for static website hosting url

## Considerations when using ChatGPT to write Terraform

LLMs such as ChatGPT may not be trained on the latest documentation or information about Terraform.

It may likely produce older examples that could be deprecated. Often affecting providers.

## Working with Files in Terraform


### Fileexists function

This is a built in terraform function to check the existance of a file.

```tf
condition = fileexists(var.error_html_filepath)
```

### Filemd5

### Path Variable

In terraform there is a special variable called `path` that allows us to reference local paths:
- path.module = get the path for the current module
- path.root = get the path for the root module
[Special Path Variable](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references#filesystem-and-workspace-info)


resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "${path.root}/public/index.html"
}

### S3 Static Hosting ClickOps
ask gpt to write u a tf for static website hosting  for an s3 bucket
...

i mean this looks like something 

lets grap something of this and see if it actally works.

No, and i'll tell u why. but it helps.


1. in main in ur mod add it as a new resource

change the bucket 

from bucket = "my-static-website-bucket" to ours aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket.


2. try tf init  (ok)

3. tf plan and see if it can do it


--argument is deprecated---

why gpt gave is the wrong thing?

the aws provider for 5.0 doesnt exist in gpt.



i dont find tf changes a lot but the provider change year in a year.

so we cant relay on gpt => go tf registry => aws provider )> aws => aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration

and get it from there instead.


replace with this:

change the example name to website_configuration

and reference the bucket likek above and we dont need any routing rules.


tf plan and see its working.!!!


tf apply !


a lot of people saying oh gpt gpt but not for everything bro.


go s3 verify the bucket => properties and go below below

take the url and output it in terraform. in nested module. 

website_endpoint and give it th evalue.

add a descrption to tis


do the same for top level and refernce it also


tfvars

s3_website_endpoint=""


## we want to upload the file

that a reasonw hy its not working..

upload an index.html file to, an s3 bucket.

this is an acton that u dont want to do with ur tf because tf is about managint the staet of infra and this is a file..

even if it can do it and we are doing it.. we might not want to us  to manage it..


we gonna learn that there are things called provisioners and u can remotly or locally execute comamnds.

where tf dont want u to do that.


if u have file, u shold have data management for that..


we will use tf for all three but its not the case for prod.


1. go registry and use aws_s3_objet and not the aws_s3_bucket_object
- specify the bucket
- the key
- the source

do the same for website configuration.


> working with files using the path
path.cmd


lets see if we can use teraform console is an interactive way to troubleshoot stuff

include path.root and see

path.module anyway it should make sense in better case..	


2. craete public dir and add the pages

3. drag the file to cli to get the absolute path

4. take e tag for now in the s3 ojbect res will talk later




looks good! plan

now apply


go to aws and see if there is a file in the bucket. and ye it is..


### now the thing

u really dont want to hardcode values like this to help the module be portable;;


one thing we can do is interpolation	

"${path.root}public/index.html"

also i noticed i did took the main tf path... no wee neede the index path..


plan and apply => the file should changed.


test more try to change the content of the htlml and do it agian and see the content of the bucket index html


apply => no changes to the file
BUT WE CHANGED our file.


Bbecause the way this work is it has a source but its not checking the data.

the tf state llook for value of the path and not what it have inside the file that is in that path.


One way to know that it with that e tag we just told u about before.

if the content cahnge= etag will change.


so we add etag= filemd5 which is a functij tat will create a hash based on the content.

consult tf functions.  

now just specify the path to etag like u did with source


now it does pick it up.




### A point Terraform Variable Instead of path.root

we do have a the path root stuff but i think its better to, pass a terraform variable.	 
because we may want to give flexinility to, this module for anyone to change the adress.

So if i want it index html but i dont want it to be stored here, i still can do this easli.



So lets setup a variable for that.


add it within the variables in modules level and add it to root level (give it the whole thing its fine)


add the path file index_html_path="/Workspace/etc/public/index and error  to TFVARS AND TF VARS SAMPLE also for the new uuid..


double the resource block to do so for the error source 


###var for error too in mod and top level




allis for tfao for apply we doing it alot...

tf apply..


we get error becaise we have to pass the vars to  root main tf index +error


now its ok good!!


but only error is up to s3


we still cant see our bucket but we did enough for this

it worked after we did appluyagain, u have to be confident cause it may lie to u, could be a latency stuff or whatever...


learned about funcions.

edit ur commands.md file

--commit: enable static wesite hosting uplodaed index and error via tf to s3.


destroy ur shit


pr


tag git tag stuff url from andrew plz (how to delete local and remote tags)



lets say i missclicked 1.1.0 tag

delete it:
e.g. git push --delete origin 1.1.0



correct it


u can create the tag from graph...


git stash hash (u'll be a detached head) tag on that part
hash is sha llol
1.1.0 and push it

git stash --save to save stuff and get it bacck


git stash apply


he added the tags part to  1.4.1 stupid.



### conclusion to next
the  reason we cant access it;
- we need a bucket policy
- u have to unblock from internet

but the only way we want to access that s3 is throuw a cloudfront distru

cause thats the best and ssafer way to do it!
