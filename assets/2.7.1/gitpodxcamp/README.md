## CDE Bootcamp Experience

I thought you might find it interesting to learn how I worked pro-like with this CDE during the bootcamp. 

I used gitpod consistently throughout the entire program—**22 days**.

I managed to do everything on the free tier—**500/month**.


Totaling **630.43** in credit consumption.<br>(I did the math)

Verify the [report](gitpod-usage--20230918-20231013.csv) integrity.

Else just [visualize](too-cleandev.md).
