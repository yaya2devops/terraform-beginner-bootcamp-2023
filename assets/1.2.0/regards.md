##### 2.1.1. Removing Random Provider

- Delete the Random Provider and its associated resources from the main Terraform configuration.

##### 2.1.2. Adjusting Bucket Configuration

- Change the bucket configuration from `bucket = random_string.bucket_name.result` to `bucket = var.bucket_name`.

##### 2.1.3. Variable Configuration

- Add a `bucket_name` variable in the `tfvars` file and define it in `var.tf`.
- Validate the `bucket_name` variable to ensure it's a valid AWS bucket name.

### 2.2. Resource Naming and Output

- Update the resource name from `example` to `website_bucket`.
- Modify the output to reflect the new resource structure: `value = aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket`.

### 2.3. Final Steps

- Execute a `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` after making these changes.
- Ensure that the old S3 resources have been deleted.

### 2.4. Additional Consideration

Consider implementing regex validation for variables, especially when validating inputs in the `variables` block.
