More notes, more awareness!!

This time we re trying to get better assets in our upload.

Also this is the end of our


because when we building website, its not going to behtml page alone
b 0
-we want that imges, javascript, stylsheets..

to make our terrahouse look very good in terra town..



Create new issue: Asset Upload

- [] Implement asset management as code
- [] use for each to upload assets
- [] explore diff data structures
- [] terraform console explore
- [] terraform complex and collection types explore



---we support to craete page that goes to a hub..between w1 and 2..maybe..

## get started with images.

drag an image to public/assets and add it to html?

grap another image.


perview site; use http server, add it gitopd..
add gitpod extensions?

--- now we have the assets in the site.


probably u shoudnt use tf to manage assets and stuff

but we will too. because it give me the possiiltiy to expplre more functionality for,this beginner lefvel



- we added resource for single file, e.g. index and error..

what if we want to do mutlile files? => for each!


i want to uploiad a folder full of files to s3 using terraform (ask gpt)

take the output on side and lets go explore more about tf console

tf init => tf console:

get a list of all files in public/assets: (fileset function : check it in registy)



path.root (whre i am)
fileset("${path.root}/public/assets","*")  all files

fileset("${path.root}/public/assets","*.{jpg,png,gif}") 


list terraform functin

learn about complex

learn about complex types (see asset below)

and then read about collectio types


in tf u may want to cast things to other things and these things are pain to deal with and u are not crazy


lets go back to our for each 

go to res-storage.tf


do resource ad name it upload assets


add for_each

it is hard coded we mau chang it with tf var

grab the other usual stuff 

bucket, key , source, content tyoe; etag

for_each stuff:
if we are using a list => will use a key
if its more complex e.g map => we need key and value


changfe the key to go to the assets and do interperlaton and each.key


for source path root eachdot key

e tag is same as source


exit out of console.

we could have dont map.

plan and see


we can see it is doing the assets!!
tfaa



we are done!!!
tf console and complex type


oh they are hardcoded we may not wnt that!!


chang the one in the asset to vars.assets_path
go defint it in module/var.tf
define it in var.tf root
do it in tfvars.sample


===> getting connection to terratown is the challenge for week2 and custom provider..

cimiit : upload assets using for each

main pull tag 1.8.0
