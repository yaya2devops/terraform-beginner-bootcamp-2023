Tasks;
- Screenshot CloudFront Serie Of Distru.
- Instruct dns => Route, Cert process.
- Create TerraHomes Webpage and present the projects.

Great and Cool.

# The How I did it

I did onboard our domain to route 53.
I did create a record for the terrahome (subdomain)
I did request a certificate for *.domain 
I specify the cert everytime in cloudfront distrus
I did Alternate domain name (CNAME) - optional for terrahome.domain
I did edit origin in behaviors to Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

When you include the cloudfront url to your route53 record. Throw it naked. Dont include the https.
