terratown test

because we will be testing our custom provider AGAINST THE real terrtowns

CReate issue:

- [ ] test our custom provider to work with productions erver
 



### COUPLE OF TINGS TO CONFIGURE to use terratown do cloud

access token u use it;
- sign up to terraformcloud
- in provider block 

provider endpoint in main tf should be 

terratowns.cloud/api

uuser uuid from exampro acc. 
aaccess token from platform



FOR TOKEN missingo


the domain dont go to anywhere but its ok. leave it.

./bin/build_pro

tf init tf apply

we have a good debug informations! as well.

click yes

GO TO terratowns.cloud/t/missingo

u'll find ur profile as a rectangle and when u click it takes u to that usles cloudfront.


NOW WHEN WE DO the cloudfrotn real url will that takes us to this 
or we have to pass custom headers or headers thourght cloudfront to make it work? 

we will fnd out..


If you have domain name change then it cant be updated (by design) u have to do total tear down.


lets do it now..

tf destroy auto..

------------------------------------------

mising is gone now.




update new domain.


bnut before u dont want to strore ur token in main;tf

Now instead of doing it in the file we can assign it to the export with this smart way.

for that we will use TF_VARS_lower_case_rest

export TF_VARS_terratowns_access_token="pastehere"
gp env TF_VARS_terratowns_access_token="pastehere"

now when we call it in main.Tf we can simply do

token= var.terratowns_access_token

also this:
so add it to terraform.tfvars terratowns_endpoint="https://terratowns.cloud/api"


user_uuid already there we can call it just var.user_uuid  

but lets emoploy our trick again!!

export TF_VARS_teachersear_user_uuid="pastehere"
gp env TF_VARS_teachersear_user_uuid="pastehere"

var.teachersear_user_uuid  even if it not in any file..

add it to the commented terrhouse module np AND IN THE VAIRBALESdottf
and one for the acces token
and one fort endpoint 

also call it:  var.terratowns_endpoint


good refactor that improved our security

set cloud front url.


init


aaply

error??
code trap looool from previous WEEK ZERO

we talked about it i the office hour.. but if u still haebve it



- at the end of the asset url in tfvars.sample add /
- in module terrrhouse_aws IN MAINTF ROOT add the aset_path = var.assets._path (pass it)


tf apply again

----

NOWOK -bucket name unique...

lets make the bucket name randm

- take bucket name from tfvars and from the terrhouse_aws
-  go to our moudle and go to cdn 
- comment the bucket name from website_bucket
- update variables coment the bucket and its validation.
- go cdn  and update it to call the bucket output normally (aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket) for OAC and its decription.
- same for the dsitru resouce block var

tf apply
AND GO LOOK AT THE BUCKet..
bbucket name it tell us after=> its random.

all perfect

now if u go u can find ur page there.
- we want to get our pages to correct location
- we may want to deploy miore than page
- we want to show how to do updates

for tf cloud we may go back and do some stuff there


next we will work on doing that on tf cloud.
