Welcome to this 2.6.0

In this one we are trying to use terraform cloud as suppose toi ur local machine..

because we are now gettinginto shape..

Another thing i want to be able to CREATE more home or more house.

the platform i think now supports twelve home or house.



---create issue:  Multi Home and Terraform Cloud (these could be 2 seperate issues)

You probably want to itemize them two seperate tihngfs as its trying to acomplish two diff goals.

(refering to tags i'll do it in branchs as well)


-  [ ] Move our state back to terraform cloud with local  execution


---create branch

now lets get our way to tf cloud..

click Try Terraform Cloud !(can feel the laugh...)

click on our terra-house-1 project


so in tf cloud we can change the execution mode to be local.
- because it is slow via tf cloud if we run the commands
- but we want to keep our state safe in the cloud.

click local and update the project level plzz.

Not for the oregaznization level.



BACK TO GITPOD

in maintf root uncomment the cloud.

also build our pulgin provider.
make it auto in gitpod. in terraform section.



tf init

tf apply to get it to cloud


now back to cloud
- tf cloud wont tell u approve or somlething it just show u whts up going on
- mayube i push te provider to registyr and we use it all.


now all resource are managed by tf cloud.

We can stop env and come back to it because our state is safe.
