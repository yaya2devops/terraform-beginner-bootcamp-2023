2.3.0 setup Skeleton for our resources (next to fill that)

previouslwe didnt deffine any resoruces for our provider. welcome to : 2 3 0 Resource Skeleton

back to our setup tuto from hashicorp.

define own data resource for home.


extensions; go and golang tools(we dont know how  to use it.)

uncomment validator in main go and bring back the log.

make sure u are on the terraform tab, because we set the debugging for that.


- build provider.

error

change ' to "" for the func validator

build again: error

include google in the import for the uuid.

we have to "go get it" aka go get githubURL ( we have to make sure we are inside that dir)

cd back and build again. 

build again: error

change the error in append to errors

build again: error

missing return, add it. I thought to add true after the return but return alone worked fine for me.

if someone knows Go better than me and build providers better than me PLZ tell me!
I am just getting it to work.

build => all fine now 
tf init => u'll see the logs and all good


tf plan => code no error but no infra


### write infa (providerConfigure function

write some junk and ask gpt if she udnersatnd


> i heard that openai can go to internet with plugin and that would be so good to find out.


build

error, indefined stuff

import more (diag, context, config).

for config we need to define our own struc  for line 26


---next thing to setup a resource

in the provider schema.pro add rsource name  terrtowns_home: res



func resource below (we can do it in its file but we will do it all together for readability)

define the four actions CRUD

everysingle res in tf provider is having these actions..

lets go code these actions as seperate functions too..


build 

errror comma, at the end of someting


build

error;  interface should be {} and not ()

build

error:


return resource  in our main func of all actions is missed 


build=> good

now we have those empty functions.



ggood to stop here since our skeleton is done.

commmit: setup skeleton for resource



note: in real project; u woudnt commit and pull requesting these, u would actually leave them in feature branch and not tag them. we wait untill the whole job is done.

but we are not doing it just so we tag and do more git stretech.

- next is where we gonna start filling the resource, making api calls to our mock api k!


at this point;
- 22 branch
- 26 tags
