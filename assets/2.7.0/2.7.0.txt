Welcome to this 2.7.0


because we are now gettinginto shape..

Another thing i want to be able to CREATE more home or more house.

the platform i think now supports twelve home or house.



---create issue:  Multi Home and Terraform Cloud (these could be 2 seperate issues)

You probably want to itemize them two seperate tihngfs as its trying to acomplish two diff goals.

(refering to tags i'll do it in branchs as well)


-  [ ] provison more thatn one home to terrattowns


---create branch


## Terrhouses setup

i need to make sure i can deploy more than a house at a time. many ways to handle this.
- do two folders and deploy seperate
- but do second home as a resource in the same maintf root.

We need another module as well. 
the paths are serving one home in the public.

we need to create sub folder in public for different pages.
take the current pages to that folder and name it something meaningful.

do new page folder and create it and add its assets dire and index and error.


back to main.Tf we have to makesome changes with terrahoiuse_aws vars.

edit the blcok.? and the other block and the module etc explain it..PLZZZzz

change the module name.

change cloudfront to domain_name.

change second module and its resource domain name; again.



lets go to our vars in our modules now.

change index vars to public path.

take the path var and the asset??//
go update the upload assets block in res storage.
go do something for index htmla nd error hmlt s3 object blocks..


"Terrahome"change the folder name for module and the module call in main root tf.

get andrew readme for the module. and enhance it.


comment ehe payday blco and its module and do npm i 
i mean tf init and plan:


it shoudnt ask for the bucket name (it is saying enter value.)


do tf state list and see the res that we have in tf cloud.. in gitpod.

do a tf state pull and do tf plan

still prompting for var bucket name.


this is confusing

all vars are commented
state is in .terraform and not in root; so its tf cloud

ah its in our vairbales in root. delete it


now plan again it is prompting for public path its ok we want that

change it in variables to homename_p√ªblic_path and add another one for my second home and comment it for now;.

update the tfvars public path after we inserted the page in nested project;


add projectpage1 content verion and page2 in tfvars sample too..




as gpt:
----
how do u set nested tf variables in tf vars file.
----
this is to make stuff look more NEAT DAMN.

and so the stuff in variables.tf root using type object.


now in our main root we can call better.


do tf init

tf plan.

errorsssssssssssssssssss


- output change it to domain_name from cloudfront_url.. we changed it


tf plan

error


top level output.Tfange to terrhome not terrhouse.

and thelast output domain_name 


tf plan
eeroor


i mean we changed it to home_arcum_hosting instead...


TF PLAN


indefined index etag path

because we cahnged it copy the one from source and put it in e tage (the previous is broke)


error

for each a numer is required add interporaltion instead.

plan is now working!!!


apply

error failed to udpate home resource, status code 422 from the server...

so our provider main.go. fix stuff



apply error sould be greater than the previous version


go to tfvars and increment the version.

tf apply


apply error sould be greater than the previous version

we updated the version.???.?? mate!

ah its hardcoded in maintf root terratowns_home "home"...

call it with varsinstead


UPDATE THE other project apge(the commented anyway)

it is working now!!

go check terrtown cloud u should see it there!


i didnt see the name because i signed in as admin.


delete it and go back to cli and apply to see if it detect cahnges..

error! 404 not found body map []

maybe its trying to parse body and there is no body to parse.
it should be equals!


build provider and tf init

and tf apply and see if we have that error again.

now it noticed that we have changes and the resoruce is gone so we can do check stuff back!


### lets try the second one!


uncomment other home blocks. just for modules and resource in main tf root.


tf init

tf apply 


perfect! now we can see our two pages listed in misingo! town


commit: fix issues with provider/setup two different towns/conneec to tf cloud.
