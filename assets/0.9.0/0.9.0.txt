TF ALIAS FOR TERRAFORM

---
can u make a tree of this directory with emojis (one folder for folders and for files? etc.)


inside the bin dir they are ll bash scripts.
- bin
--- gen_tfrc
--- install_aws_cli
--- install_terraform_cli
--- tf_alias
---

set an alias to be tf in our bash script ( to have shortcut for typing terraform)

--- make it branch--- go to the branch and launch gitpod


go to bash profile with telda



open shift and bak tick/.bash_profile

alias tf="terraform"


when u update the bash profile ull have to update it


so e can write source teldaÂ§//bashprf  to reload it


that it.


gitpod wont make this allist presist unless we make script for it.



writ a bash script that will add the following allias to our .bash_profile
alias tf="terraform"


add the script to both aws and tf block in gitpod to automate it(idont trust it)
it wont have it double but we can use it in our both terminals.

commit it: #nb add script to setup tf alias


create pr
