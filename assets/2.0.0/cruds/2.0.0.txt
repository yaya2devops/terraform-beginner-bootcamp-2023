2.0.0

we will focus on bringing the terratown server.


u gonna need to bring all this code..


there so many ways to embeedd th emock server.. 
- we can bring it as a git submodule (i find it very dificutl when goes wrong)
- we could git checkout and not coomit to our repo( but if we want to change something on the fly it sucks..we cant do this)


the preffered method: bring the code to our repo. staticaly live there.


go our repo:

Create new issue;

### Step 1: Create a New Issue
- Go to our project's repository.
- Create a new issue titled "Terratown Mock Server."
- Label it as an enhancement.


Terratown mock server

download terratown mock server into our repo

label it as enhancement.

get branch from it.

(after git graph)



--- how to clone a repo with the git directory its being track..
-1: zip it
-2 clone it and remove .git

clone terratowns_mock_server

after cloning get rid of the .Git direcotryy

ls -la

that gitpod yml wont do anything becus gitpod works only on root. and past the one from this to root and terminate it.


---  change bin folder to terratowns and move scripts to other bin direcotory, chmod all

and commit our server.

#XX Copy terratowns mock server to our repo and move bin into main.


stop wroskapce and go launch branch againi via gitpod.

sinatra starts

so sinatra is a single but also a framework for web apps.

sinatrarb.com

the file is server.rb works with the gems that are in gemfile to make the server works

---docs--- get it

---comment on code---

learn about active model in rails as an ORM


also learn about getter and setter.. very famous..

learn about rails validations.. and it format..



go to terratowns.cloud

cooker-coke (the perma link in validaiton)


---end-comment-on-code----

--

diagram the second diagram (downloaded and modified by me)

--

back to comment the manually parse stuff  l130/126 etc

134 135


142

---- commit 2 to branch: document mock server and add validation for inclusion




--next thing bash script
we have to first stop our server.. because our server doesnt reload code..
  if we make changes we have to completey stop and start.

we can make it so..im not gonna add that in there..


ctrl +c--->bundle exec command.



--server ready back to bash scripts.

write me a bash script that will send me a post request o an endpoint 


we asked gpt;---- its nott intermediate bootcamp so we have it ready but u can see hhow i did it..
localhost:4567/api/u/:user_uuid/homes/ with a POST it should have a headers of content type and accept  application json.
it should expect a bearer authorization token


the pay load json should have the follownig fileds, name descirpito, content_version, town, domain name.


--run bin/create script --returns uuid for the house.
(thats all the privder want for)

go check sintarta ull see it gave something..


---- do the read script and pass the uuid from create read <uuid>


--- do the update script.--- update <uuid>
It will will complain!!!

 (that is our code trap)
there is an issue with the code. Thats the trap  baby.


in the update we dont the domain names. the domain names and the town should only do initially once.


back to the server. and correct the issue.
we need to go to udpate action.

should we refactor it?( mayble later.) just lets go to th update.


216 line add domain like town..

run udpate now..  it will give same error because we have to rerun the server.


do new create get new uuid, read and then update.

error? again?

the error is double line in domain name. but lets not correct it and actually add the follwoing at the end

we can do binding.pry at the end and see the error btw.


do new create get new uuid, read and then update.


it is now hanging=> this is correct. go to sinatra now it stoppping we can interact with the code directly.

type  home => it is now showing 

do home.domain_name

do payload and see there is no domain there.. shoudnt be set there

do $home[:domain_name] --thats our problem..

oh so we dont need the home.domain_name = domain_name / leave the one with []


now exit..



--start over the server

create read and update.  => great now!! go to sintara and observe all steps.. 


check read btw new house decription... 


we can now delete it.


add the uuid at the end line 240.. (its not code trap but we have to fix this)

do delete u'll see it reutnrs the uuid now.

they are all scripts smiliar scripts tho just one post one get oneetc..



However; 
- [There is another code trap no one get it??]
- thoughts to refactor stuff?




ready to build custom provider.
