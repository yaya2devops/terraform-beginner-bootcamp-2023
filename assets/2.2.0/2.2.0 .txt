2.2.0 

we are back to same branch: terrratowns provider


build the build script provider
errors!!

cant sat terraformrc


mkdir miss click

now do script

it will give u the binairy but also a weird directory with telda..

delete permanant we dont ned

go corect the script.. path.. for plugin dir var annd rm

no error now: we have binairy
check if its in 
/ho!me/hiitpod/.terraform.D/pulign/localprovider/etc..



now THAT OUR lib is congirugred we have to confiugure it in our terraform

## Configure Custom provider

to to main.tf

specify the terraform block with our aporivder.

and below create the provider block itself. endpooint, ser uuid, token

these are the two we need required uuid and token

go take mock from create script.


build provider again.
terraform init

error

include misses include.


build again script and init => better no errors.


when u do stuff like that => having log levels will make things easier.


lets set the log level to be TF_LOG=DEBUG tf init

lets go to gitpod and set debug mod in env in terraform block (a little verbose but wil get job done)


we can now debug info and good stuff. when things are messed up with out go long those logs will help.


> tf plan we get errors.


- make sure u comment ur module block
- make sur eu comment all output lines in root.

tf plan and no changes )=> things are working ok noww

apply will generate tf state empty but its nice..

=> commit to same branch 47 terratowns-provider: 

title: Implement tf provider block in tf
should be able to create run terraform provider block without errors


Intent for conflict and resolve.

branch same
tag: 2.2.0
