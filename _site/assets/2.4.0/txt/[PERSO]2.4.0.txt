we did defined our schema...

we need to define the schema for our resource.


i want to call it home resource. but since its the only resource.. we call it just resource.


this in main.go

inside the name, description, domain name, town, add the inside stuff.

after that lets see if that complile..

bin/build_provider

go to maintf in the root level.. add new resource

terrtown_home and name it "home"

that have description, town,  content_version..

u can choose where u want to put ur page. (e.g; gamers-groto)

do the trick od description with << >> like in EOC

and add domain name..we get it from our other project..cloudfront url! inn output

build and init.. 

error.. fqiled to query  avaialbel provider  pcakges...

check thhe terraformrc... 

cd etc...the file is there.


we didnt finish anything with the code.. we still have empty resources in main.go it may be why..

lets keep coding and see.

- code create action.
- code the read (called resourcehouseread in main.go)
- code the update
- code delete

all of them need config.

add http request and endpoint to the craete.
add authorization and our brearer token to the cerate...
set the header for the content type..c
set the accept..	


looks smiliar to delete...

for read it is get.. and we want the homeUUID in the /home/ and update similar but put.

annd for delete same as create but Delete  and also homeUUID


add homeUUID := .. for read and update and delete



next we actuall have to do the client call. AFTER THE HEADER in the delete and do the samein update, read and create.




this is repetitive but could be a way to refactor it..........not doing it now.


---remade here: https://chat.openai.com/share/97b6e708-03da-44d8-b5ca-41434d49a351

now we need to pay a payload for a post. AND THE MESSAGE BODY TO CONTAIN all the details (refer to request diaggram))

lets get back to create we need to pass payload block after the config.

we need to make it a format to get it in.

THERE IS A JSON FUNC that do the job just after playload. to conver to bites and add it as argment to the next;.


after doing the playload and putint the body we should get a response there. we want to do somethign with the response. we will parse it. 

after the resp.Body.Clos()




get the code that will get the error from the server to us if it happened. in create

if resp.
tatusCode != http.statsok
{etc}


---- up to here.

we want one for deelete as well..



we need now to set a  value of ID.
whenever u have a resource for terraform it always want u to retun id 


IN CREATE
ADD

homeUUID:= response uuid string 
AND d.set it




## the read block

now fo the read

we have to have the home id.

remake the respostatus dode  amake it if else.. 

IF IT ITS OK  RETurn the data...
d.Set

for all the conten t for read... responseData[ name, content, desc, domai..]

we may have the status is not there to avoid config drift.

### Update block

we also need the playload from create paste it to the update. BUT take the domain the town because its notallowed to change those.

reutn those payload for  d.set(name, ,playload(naame)
d.set(desc, desc description and content ver



### Now code the delete

set id if successul is the only thing ..

we can add it as else


but just leave it outside..


-- fist test-- will it work.

./bin/build_provider

some issues. syntax error 


MIISING THE nill here instead of err != { do err != nil {

./bin/build_provider

undefinfed json, add it to our import.

./bin/build_provider


http error, add it netÂµ/htp to import

./bin/build_provider

undefined.FrontErr change it to FromErr

./bin/build_provider

bytes is libairry add it to import 

./bin/build_provider


ERROR TYPE IS NOT AN EXPERRESIOn
 in line 152,199 and 295 cange error to just err

./bin/build_provider



RESPONSE DATA IS NOT FEDINED;;

take the var line from INSIDE THE FIRST If to outside otherwise it wont know what it iS (we need to edcode from enterior)


./bin/build_provider


playloadBytes declared but not used in line because we have to pass it instead of nill in line 255.



make it bytesNewbuffer stuff becaue it wont read.

do the same for craete action etc and read only.


- ./bin/build_provider

error type not found

change it type to err

- ./bin/build_provider

unfedined responseData

we dont need repsonseData fr the update. We dont care about that.

Take it and take the body %

- ./bin/build_provider

unfedined responseData

do the same for delete

- ./bin/build_provider
NOW WE HAVE IT BUILT!!

if its confusing its ok(its not)=>things will get huger when we start lookinn to tfstatefile


### This will actually provision anything?
the question now does it actually work?

this is talking to our server sintara.


tf init => failed to query avilable provider packages.


make the resource called terratowns_home resource in maintf instead of terratown_home.. because its called teratown_home in the func provider of the schema provider in main.go


tf init => works now. 


tf plan => we have the resource! a custom resource is made!

mock server is not real..So it will not work the excact same

we can PLAY A LITTLE BIT AROUND before trying on the real tertown.


tf apply ! 
------- remake: https://chat.openai.com/share/b4bc03a1-48ec-48f0-aaa7-0ba620f72db4

ERRRORS

spelling mistake domain_namae...make it name.

now we have to build again for it to delete bunch of files.

- ./bin/build_provider

tf INIT AND  apply !


It is not liking our code block fo <
THE ERROR end up related to parsin JSON (asked gpt and now make sense)

Because if u get back something that is not json andhtml and start with that char u woudnt be able to parse it.



invalid char < looking for beiginning  of value...
error

we tried adding the url =congif.endpoint at "/home"  (line150)
and we print th eurl.

build, init, apply.

error because we have to jhit the api/home instead

so copy that and take it to read res



now we have a refacctored part..


build, init, apply.

still same errror but now doing api/Home

go to create script it is actually only home.

go back and terminate the api leave it only ..

the issue is actually in our endpoint in maintf add /api to localhost.

----


it will now work. => 1 res createed.


its holding this state: we should be able to keep mocking it..



look state file and see if ther eis senitive data (good lesson to be learn)
- its not storing here 
- we can see our schema for the resource and the provider we did.
- thhe most import thing is the id, this is that terraform proivder really care about to keep the mapping in place.


### lets make change



change name to resource name. in main.tf and we got error.

> we wanted home but it is House e.g. HouseCreate..

change init to float64


another erro because we have statefile..

error i mean

because in one plce its init in other its float64

create- int
read- float64 

why? idk why it the way the response back.

update -int


build; delete sstate, stop sinatra, tf init, tf apply --auto-a


it created
- go sintara and see it



make change and re apply
- it notice the desccription changed. say yes.

see state its now having the updated ones..

we have double name in the update its doubling in statefile. make it description. and double check

- do an update to the description or name and run tf apply
- make sure sintara runnin


update and shown at same time (the apply)


it will update our state...and the names are like we want them to be.

destory our state will be gone!! all perfect


everythin is working guys!


considerations
- is there edge cases: idk.
- is there things not considered: idk
its very hard to write a good provider terraform. 
Its impressive to do ths and this is cool!



This is hard stop because we done a lot.

- The next thing is using the provider with the real terratown endpoint
- we will need terratown accounts and getting the access.
