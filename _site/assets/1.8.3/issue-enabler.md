#### Title: Streamline Git Graph Visualization To Gitpod
Hey Terraformer! I'll expose for you the way to installing and automating two visual IDE visual extensions that will elevate your Git skills.
- [ ] Installing the Git-Log-Graph extension from VS Code.
- [ ] Installing the Git Graph (mhutchie.git-graph) extension from VS Code.
- [ ] Automating the Git-Log-Graph extension using Gitpod.
- [ ] Automating the Git Graph (mhutchie.git-graph) extension using Gitpod.

This conludes an **exciting first week at the bootcamp!** 
I'll still have to go and adjust every branch to merge all the work done into something for your benefit.
