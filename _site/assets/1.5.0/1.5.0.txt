### CDN 

We are going to implemet the cdn in front of it to be able to see the website which will be next hooked up to terratowns.


ask gpt


aws cloudfront serving static website hosting for an s3 bucket using terraform.

it gave us already the bucket (we did that)


the policy res ye  will be usng this. like we did with clickops.


now for the origin config, it is giving us origin access identity.


aws have new way of doing it which is origin acces controle... gpt will never about this.. this comes last year..


- ye it can write much terraform
- not accurate cold be junk

go to tf registry and get cloudfront distru
go aws provider-> aws-> aws_cloudfront_disrtubution

it show up data (not now)
 we went data sources..

go resources expand; and do it instead.

we have an eample of s3 origin to cloudfront.

Looks decent to me 


copy it  and hold on.

----

 create an issue: cdn  Implementation (contnet delivery network)

- [] setup cloudfront distru
- [] cloudfront origin access control setup
- [] setup bucket policu


### Creating an Issue: CDN Implementation

- [ ] Set up CloudFront Distribution.
- [ ] Configure CloudFront Origin Access Control.
- [ ] Set up Bucket Policy.

---branch it and gitpod it

back the hold. (our main is getting much cdn is long)


1. create resource-cdn.tf	
2. create resource-storage.tf
3. brin all storage stuff and paste it to resources-storage.tf
4. grap the code in the docs from cdn and put it in res-cdn.Tf not all of it.
5. the alias for custom domain we dont need
6. we dont want to pass the query string alne
7. we are not passing any cookies
8. allow all policy is good
9. now all this caching behavoior
we dont need all this behavior just the default.

10. specify some geo restrictioons
change the type to none	and delete it, but we can specify if we want some coutnry only



11. tag specify the uuid, like we did for before.

12 specify the certification https for free.

this is wont work alone because it expects in the origin {} 

### Specify required vars
 

access control id=origin_access_control 

and 
origin id= local.

what local is is way to pass local variables.. we can pass it as env var but this is a good examplle to use  local..


beore the resource in cdn.tf

add 

local {
}

now for the origin_access_control

go registry and write 

Aws_cloud_front_origin_access_control

take the block to ur code;
0. for resource name change examplle to default
1.  change the name and do interperloation to inject bucket name

2. do decription
3. the rest network man hm idk
that shoulld be set, whats left is bucket policy ony..

### Add the bucket policy block



registry aws_s3_bucket_policy

i realy took much time to get that policy i jst give it to u... 


or lets create it
1. take the sampe sage from the registry
2 change the name from allow.. to "bucket_policy"
3. reference our bucket to website_bucket.bucket


> if we have one of something we can name everything default.?!..wow	

we may go back and make them all default later...but anway that the idea..



coming back to our block, now  we have to specify our policy.

for this we can literally

policy =jsonencode(
{write json over here lol convinient}
)

4. take the policy from aws cloudfront introduces origin access control oac blog policy in there..



ok we can make exactly json here but close;
 
5. change : to = for alll

thats how hcl works, its the underline syntax that is use by terraform. its what makes terraform.


 we only need on statement take the seocnd block starts wih sid


for the first statement, we want sid, effect, version, principal, acion.


what we want to change is the bucket. 

6. add interpolations ${aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.id}


7. we have conditions, we need to restrict this to specify distru or acc.
|it is asknig for an account id|


this is a good way to use data

when u go to aws provider and registry type data source u'lll have all listed


we want to use something for aws_id in the policy 

we can use the aws_caller-identity... we previously used that as a way to vlaidate our account in the cli. :)




so using that we can grap the acc id.

8. add the data resource to main module

data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {} 

now we can reference this wherever, this is all it takes.

we can now do the value which is the data.aws_caller_identity.account_id.


9. in our data policy,  add into the interpolation the data.aws_caller_identity.account_id.



whats left now is the distruname..

add trh interpolation 

${}

go to cloudfront distu registy link => reference  see the id add the var for the dsitru in interpolation as awell


> we could use done arn  but we wanted to use the data source 	



all good tf init and plan


errored1: we did local instead of locals

another error 2: we had the id in the bucket policy res outside {}.id , should be {.id}


---
for the data.aws_imag..allow_access_from_another_account.json

if we have our polcy on aws we can referece it.
(we create it in iam)


it did work but => in downloading the file. its not launching.


the mistery is, we referenced the file, we didnt say to tf what type of file ur dealing with.


go registry=> aws => s3_object => content type in argument reference on the right toc


to resource  "aws_s3_object" "index.html"

add content_type="text/html"

the same to: 
to resource  "aws_s3_object" "error.html"



---> still downloading the file.......Why

:lamp: its cdn it caches values. for it to work u have to clear cache.


go clloudfront=> clcik ur dstru=> invalidations pane=> create invaidation

add this

/* 


will clear the cache of all.. u can also specify one bye one..


when its done double check the url.


still dowloading.... 


i dont trust the bucket.

delete it. it will cause config drift otaly fine

use a new index file ask for htmll file wih header and pretty from gpt.
update beter html and error.

jut plan and apply to upload the files again.


now we have to go to clloufront and do another validation.......;

I mean we gotta automate this stuff. when we cahnge something it changes. (something we may look for soon)


CHECK THE URL=> IT DOESSSSSSSSSS WORK NOW!!!



### Cloudfront is a headech

it realy takes a lot to spin up so we may consider

the 	retain_on_delete flag


lets destroy to test this


commit-create cdn and serve s3 from cdn


pr

tag and check graph (plz download extension)


#### recap next steps

we did data sources, local

next is to look for invalidating the cache when we want actually to invlaidte
