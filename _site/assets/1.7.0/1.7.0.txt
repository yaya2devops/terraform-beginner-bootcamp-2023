### 1 7 0 Invalidate Cache Local Exec


Another push note for you baby!


now we will focus on invalidte cachce process via code in tf


- he careatd the ticket (invalidate cloudfront distrubution

-  [] Impelment data_source for content_version vs the null resource
- [ ] triger cloudront distrubution invalidation
- familaizer urself provisioners incl local exec and remote exec
- implement local exec
-create issue and make a branch out of it.
- [] configure cloudfront disru output




we gonna use terraform data again!!!    

there is no way to invalidate cache with the latest terraform version..


- try asking gpt :

invalidate cloudfront distru using terraform 

it is using the null resopurce which is pretty good. this is actuallly the way to do it.


null resource is the old way=> tf data is the new way of doing it.
tf data is better becaus eit doenst requrie u to install a provider..

we want to have it so when we have our conten change so we have a clicommand in the background that do the invaliation.

ps: provisioner like remote exec and local exec are discoured because there is other tools that can do the job like ansible.

some companyu still doing it... 

tf is for managing the state of code and not config manatgement but we wil do it. becaus ei want u to get comfortable with it.


---



go to resource cdn and add the reosurce tf dat and trigger the content verions
```

```

we want also to triigger a priovioner... the local exec run on local machine that is running the te'rraform 

if we use tf cloud 
the local machine should be whatever tf cloud comutenis...

u can use remote exec wich allows u to poiinnt to off to some kind of comptue and do ssh.

but we will am=keit simple here with local compute..


ADD Ttis stuff inside the local exec..
heredoc  learn

command <<command

something

command


add inside it the required block abd see..

-- andrew paused to document, go take that plzzz.;;---





provisioners are just a measure of pragmatism. it have the capabiltiy but iuts better fit for ...

after adding to cdn RES FILe do
tfp

now it is prompting for the conven version???

BECAUSE THE content_version=2 wasnt set. 

set the value tto ur tfvars

and then do
tfpaa



one thing i want here is the cloudront distru output..

add it to ur output in module

output ..

{value}


go to ur root output and add stuff too


tfpaa and see the new output.

![New Output]()


trey change soemthign and do tfp

it would detec anything 

because we haver toi increment the content version

and do again tfp and tfa


to verify we have to checj the website anbd se cache expird. meaning go to invcalidation and see u'll find validations done

now u can se the link (its in the output. also)

should work!



tf destroy

and get back the version to 1


-commit: invalidate cloudfront stack when content version changes!!!


go to pr and do it!!


go main pull and tag!
